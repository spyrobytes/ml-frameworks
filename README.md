# Machine Learnign Frameworks and MLOps

## Project Overview

LLM frameworks create layers of abstractions on top of the LLM API's. Core LLM functionalities can be achieved by directly interacting with the LLM API, which provide a flexible, direct interface for interacting with models. So, for straightforward tasks like text generation, summarization, or question answering, directly interacting with the LLM API (such as OpenAI's API) is usually sufficient. 

For more sophisticated tasks, such as orchestrating multi-step workflows (in LangChain) or indexing large amounts of data (in LlamaIndex), the frameworks provide higher-level abstractions that simplify the development process.

This project will explore the process of developing machine learning apps using foundational models and MLOps.
